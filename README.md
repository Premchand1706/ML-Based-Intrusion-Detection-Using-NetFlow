**Machine Learning-Based Network Intrusion Detection Using NetFlow Traffic Analysis**

This project presents a high-performance Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) developed using a large-scale NetFlow dataset containing 1,048,575 labeled network flow records. Unlike traditional signature-based systems that rely on predefined attack patterns, this system analyzes flow-level statistical and temporal traffic features to detect malicious activity. Each record represents a complete communication session between a source and a destination device and includes more than 50 features such as packet counts, byte volumes, protocol information, flow duration, throughput, TCP flags, retransmissions, and inter-packet arrival times. The model classifies traffic as either Normal or Malicious based purely on behavioral patterns, making it scalable and suitable for modern high-speed networks.

The primary objective of this project is to design and evaluate multiple supervised machine learning algorithms and determine the most effective model for cyber attack detection. The workflow begins with systematic data preprocessing, including handling missing values, separating input features (X) and target labels (Y), and applying feature scaling for scale-sensitive models such as KNN and Logistic Regression. To evaluate model generalization capability, the dataset was divided using three different train–test splits: 80:20 (test size 0.2), 60:40 (test size 0.4), and 20:80 (test size 0.8). This strategy ensures a comprehensive assessment of learning stability under varying training data proportions.

Seven classification algorithms were implemented and compared: Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), CatBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Logistic Regression (LR), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). These models represent diverse machine learning paradigms, including tree-based learning, ensemble boosting techniques, distance-based classification, and linear decision models. Each model was independently trained and evaluated using overall accuracy as the primary performance metric.

Experimental results demonstrate that tree-based models significantly outperform linear models for flow-based intrusion detection. The Decision Tree Classifier achieved the highest overall accuracy of 94.26% at the 0.2 test split and maintained strong performance across other splits. K-Nearest Neighbors closely followed the Decision Tree model, while CatBoost and LightGBM consistently achieved accuracy above 90%. Gradient Boosting produced moderate results near 89%, and linear models such as Logistic Regression and LDA recorded comparatively lower but stable accuracy around 85%. A slight decrease in accuracy was observed as the test size increased, indicating the importance of sufficient training data for optimal model learning.

Overall, this project confirms that machine learning techniques applied to detailed NetFlow traffic features can effectively detect cyber attacks in network environments. The findings highlight the effectiveness of tree-based and non-linear models in capturing complex traffic behavior patterns and demonstrate the potential of data-driven intrusion detection systems for enhancing modern cybersecurity infrastructure.
